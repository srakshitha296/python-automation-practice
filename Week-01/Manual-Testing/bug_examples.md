# Bug Examples

## High Severity, Low Priority
- App crashes only when a very rare sequence of actions is done (not many users affected immediately)

## Low Severity, High Priority
- Company logo is missing on homepage → doesn't break functionality, but branding is urgent

## High Severity, High Priority
- Login is broken for all users → both severe and urgent
