## What’s a Router?
Think of a router as the traffic controller of your home or office network.
It connects your devices (phone, laptop, TV) to the internet.
It gives internal IP addresses to each device on your local network (like 192.168.0.101, etc.)
External IP (public) is the one assigned by your ISP (like 142.250.205.46 for Google).
It often comes with built-in Wi-Fi too.

## What’s a Switch?
A switch connects multiple devices in the same local area network (LAN).
It forwards data only to the correct device, unlike a hub that sends data to everyone.
Used in labs, offices, or classrooms with wired devices.

## What’s a Port?
A port is a logical endpoint for communication.
Every app/service running on a device listens to a port number.

Examples:
HTTP runs on port 80
HTTPS → 443
FTP → 21
SSH → 22

It’s like a door on your house. IP is the address, port is the specific room/service.

## What is DHCP?
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on your network.
Without DHCP, you'd have to manually set IPs on every phone, laptop, etc.
Router usually has DHCP enabled.

## What is DNS?
Domain Name System

DNS is like the phonebook of the internet.
It translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (142.250.205.46).

When you type a website name, DNS is what helps your device find the correct server.

## Summary:
Term	Role
Router	Connects your local network to the internet
Switch	Connects devices within your local network
Port	Communication channel for services on devices
DHCP	Automatically gives IP addresses to devices
DNS	Converts domain names to IP addresses
